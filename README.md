# Ecommerce-Backend
In this challenge we were tasked with finishing the backend of an ecommerce platform!

# summary:
We began with a starter code that had some of the backend completed and we were tasked with finish the get and post requests in the routes along with connecting the database and seeds. The end result is viewable in Insomnia where you can add products, tags and categories, change them or delete them!
